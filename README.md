# honegger.dev - Portfolio Website for Pascal Honegger

My personal work-in-progress portfolio website.

## Developing

After first clone you'll need to run `pnpm install` (using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)).
You can then start a development server by running the following commands:

```bash
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev --open
```

## Building

You can easily create a static production version:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview` or simply serve the webapp using any webserver.
