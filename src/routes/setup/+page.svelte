		<h2>Tech-Stack</h2>

		<section>
			<p>
				This website was built by myself using <a
					href="https://kit.svelte.dev/"
					rel="noopener noreferrer external"
					target="_blank">SvelteKit</a
				>
				as a framework and
				<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer external" target="_blank"
					>Tailwind CSS</a
				>
				for creating my custom styles. I decided to opt into
				<a href="https://pnpm.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer external" target="_blank">pnpm</a> to manage
				my NPM dependencies and greatly reduce install times. I'm a good web developer but by no means
				a designer, but I still like the way this site turned out.

		<h2>CI/CD</h2>

		<section>
			<p>
				Of course, no modern website can operate without continuous integration and deployment. I
				decided to use <a
					href="https://github.com/features/actions"
					rel="noopener noreferrer external"
					target="_blank">GitHub Actions</a
				> to get the job done.

		<h2>Hosting</h2>

		<section>
			<p>
				The obvious solution for hosting this static website would be the cloud. But if I did that,
				I couldn't easily experiment with cool features like HTTP/3, TLS 1.3, a custom DMZ and all
				the problems that come with hosting a site yourself.
